always require "ludy" first when you use any tool of ludy
(although there are tools that needn't this init)

e.g.

require 'ludy'       # when you're using ludy gem
require path_of_ludy # when you aren't using ludy gem

then you could require other ludy tools

e.g. for use of Ludy::this

require 'ludy/this'  # for a common way when you're using ludy gem
require path_of_this # for a common way when you aren't using ludy gem

require_ludy 'this'  # tool in ludy that help ludy handle the requirement
