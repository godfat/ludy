== DESCRIPTION:
  
Aims to extend Ruby standard library, providing some useful tools that's not existed in the standard library.

== FEATURES:
  
* ludy standard library extension
* puzzle_generator
* c++ erb meta-programming tasks

== SYNOPSIS:

curry:
  require 'ludy/curry'
  assert_equal 29, :+.to_proc.curry[18][11]

bind:
  require 'ludy/bind'
  assert_equal [9,8,7], ([1,2,3].map &(lambda{|lhs, rhs| lhs-rhs}.bind 10, :_1))

chain:
  f1 = lambda{|v| v+1}
  f2 = lambda{|v| v+2}
  f3 = f1.chain f2
  assert_equal [6,7], f3[5]

compose:
  f1 = lambda{|v| v+1}
  f2 = lambda{|v| v*2}
  f3 = f1.compose f2
  assert_equal 21, f3[10]

untranspose:
  assert_equal [a, b], [a, b].transpose.untranspose

lazy:
  Y = lambda{|f|
    lambda{|x| lazy{f[x[x]]} }[lambda{|x| lazy{f[x[x]]} }]
  }

y_combinator:
  fact = Y[lambda{|this|
    lambda{|n| n==1 ? 1 : n*this[n-1]}
  }]
  assert_equal(3628800, fact[10])

variable:
  include Ludy
  class Qoo
    def cool
      'cool ~~~~'
    end
  end
  x = var Qoo.new
  y = x
  assert_equal 'cool ~~~~', x.cool
  assert_equal 'cool ~~~~', y.cool

  x.__obj__ = nil

  assert x.nil?
  assert y.nil?

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby 1.8/1.9
* rake
* gem facets in some features

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install ludy
